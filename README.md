# Feature-Engineering-Bike-Share-Rentals
This was a feature engineering assignment that demonstrated how important it is to help the modeling process of the dataset. This dataset is used to predict the number of bike share rentals.

# Feature Engineering Coding

# Summary/Conclusion
Based on the bagged regression modeling of both the engineered and original datasets, the modeling process seemed to be more efficient and more effective on the engineered dataset than that of the original. This comes to show that the importance of being able to engineer feature data can never be understated.
